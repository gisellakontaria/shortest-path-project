CS 225 Data Structures Team Contract (ojasmor2-aayushb3-classen3-grk3)

Communication
Team Meetings: We will meet every week, and the day and time of the next meeting will be decided at the end of the current meeting since we may have different schedules on different weeks, so we can decide on a time that everyone is comfortable with. We will meet in person for our meetings, unless it is more convenient to meet via Discord/Zoom, and each meeting should last about an hour, but that might change depending on what we have to discuss. We will write a paragraph of all the important things we did in the past week during our meetings.

Assistance: Our team will use Discord to communicate with each other. We can also use email to communicate if it happens to be more convenient. We will commit to respond to Discord messages on the same day unless the message is sent after 7pm and 48 hours for emails.

Respect: The team will ensure everyoneâ€™s voices are heard during meetings by allowing ample time for discussion. A simple majority will serve to resolve disputes. During the start of meetings, each member will have the opportunity to talk about what they worked on the past week and if they have any questions/suggestions moving forwards.
Collaboration
Work Distribution: Work will always be distributed equally. This can be done by looking at what deliverables need to be completed in the foreseeable future (one to two weeks). Team members can volunteer to complete tasks on a case by case basis. If a team member thinks they are particularly well suited to complete a task they can volunteer to help or take over if needed. A team mentality should always be kept in mind when splitting up work. The success of the team hinges on everyone playing to their strengths.

Time Commitment: We expect each group member to work in a ballpark of 2-6 hours per week. If their work is taking significantly longer than the agreed upon hours per week, the rest of the team will be asked to pitch in to help get the work done quicker. If someone has an occasional conflict that causes their work to be late, they can finish their work a few days earlier.

Conflict Resolution: Each side of the conflict will lay down their arguments and reasoning for the side they are arguing for, and then we will vote on the choice to make. We will decide based on a simple majority. If a member is habitually not accomplishing their tasks or is habitually late, we will politely ask them about their situation, and if their explanation does not explain their actions, we will have to contact course staff.
